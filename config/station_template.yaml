# Snow Depth Sensor Station Configuration Template
# Copy this file and rename to station_XX.yaml for each station
#
# 52Pi Easy Multiplexing Board row plan:
#   - Row 1 (reserved): LoRa plug-and-play board/bonnet
#   - Other rows: external sensor wiring
# NOTE: All rows are mirrored breakouts of the same Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
# "Row" does not change BCM pin numbers.
# Do not use LoRa/OLED pins for sensors: GPIO2,3,7,8,9,10,11,25

# Station Identification
station_id: "STN_XX"  # Unique identifier for this station (must be changed per Pi)

# Location (WGS84 coordinates)
latitude: 0.0         # Decimal degrees
longitude: 0.0        # Decimal degrees
elevation_m: 0.0      # Meters above sea level

# Sensor Configuration
ground_height_mm: 2000  # Distance from sensor to bare ground (no snow)
trigger_pin: 23         # HC-SR04 TRIG (BCM GPIO23, physical pin 16)
echo_pin: 24            # HC-SR04 ECHO input (BCM GPIO24, physical pin 18) via 1k/2k divider

# Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
temp_sensor_enabled: true  # Enable DS18B20 temperature sensor
temp_sensor_pin: 4         # 1-Wire DATA on BCM GPIO4 (physical pin 7) with 4.7k pull-up to 3.3V

# OLED Display (on LoRa Bonnet)
oled_enabled: true  # Enable OLED status display

# Measurement Settings
measurement_interval_seconds: 900  # 15 minutes = 900 seconds
samples_per_reading: 5             # Number of readings to average

# LoRa Configuration
lora_frequency: 915.0       # MHz (915.0 for US ISM band)
lora_spreading_factor: 7    # 7-12, higher = longer range, slower
lora_bandwidth: 125000      # Hz
base_station_address: 0     # Address of the base station
station_address: 1          # This station's address (unique per station)

# Local Storage Configuration
primary_storage_path: "/home/pi/snow_data"         # Primary local storage on SD card
backup_storage_path: "/mnt/snow_backup/snow_data"  # Optional SSD mirror location
backup_sync_mode: "immediate"                      # Mirror writes after each reading
backup_required: false                             # false = continue on SD if SSD is unavailable
max_local_files: 30                                # Days of local data to keep

# Optional Metadata
install_date: "2024-01-01"  # Installation date
notes: ""                    # Any notes about this station location
